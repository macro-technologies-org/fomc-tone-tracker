## 1. MPC STRUCTURE — 9 MEMBERS

Unlike the FOMC's 19-member structure, the BoE MPC has exactly **9 voting members** at every meeting. There are no alternate voters or rotating seats — all 9 vote every time.

### Current MPC (as of Feb 2026)

| # | Member | Role | Type | Term Ends | Feb Vote |
|---|--------|------|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **Andrew Bailey** | Governor | Internal | Jun 2028 | HOLD |
| 2 | **Clare Lombardelli** | DG Monetary Policy | Internal | Jun 2029 | HOLD |
| 3 | **Sarah Breeden** | DG Financial Stability | Internal | Oct 2028 | CUT |
| 4 | **Dave Ramsden** | DG Markets & Banking | Internal | Aug 2027 | CUT |
| 5 | **Huw Pill** | Chief Economist | Internal | Sep 2027 | HOLD |
| 6 | **Catherine L. Mann** | External | External | Aug 2027 | HOLD |
| 7 | **Swati Dhingra** | External | External | Aug 2028 | CUT |
| 8 | **Megan Greene** | External | External | Jul 2026 | HOLD |
| 9 | **Alan Taylor** | External | External | Sep 2027 | CUT |

### Feb 2026 Vote: 5-4 HOLD at 3.75%
- **HOLD (5):** Bailey, Greene, Lombardelli, Mann, Pill
- **CUT (4):** Breeden, Dhingra, Ramsden, Taylor

### Key Structural Differences from FOMC:
- **9 members, all vote every time** (vs FOMC's 12 voters from 19)
- **5 internal + 4 external** (externals appointed by Chancellor, 3-year terms)
- **8 meetings per year** (vs FOMC's 8, but no SEP/dots equivalent)
- **Quarterly MPR** (Monetary Policy Report, replaces Inflation Report) — published at 4 of 8 meetings
- **Individual vote rationales published in minutes** — far more transparent than FOMC, each member's reasoning spelled out
- **No dot plot** — but individual votes + rationales give equivalent signal
- **Governor breaks ties** (never happened)

## 3. MEMBER TONE PROFILES — PRE-MARCH ASSESSMENT

### HOLD BLOC (5)

**Andrew Bailey** (Governor) — Score: ~+3 (Lean Hawk)
- Voted hold in Feb; placed weight on risk from weaker activity BUT judged evidence not yet sufficient for a cut
- Jan 16: Bellagio speech on global imbalances — no direct rate signal
- Feb 8: AlUla speech — emphasized resilience, structural challenges, multilateral cooperation
- Stance: Cautious centrist. Neither extreme. Wants more evidence before next cut.
- Key quote from Feb minutes: "not currently facing a situation in which monetary policy is being hit by big new shocks"

**Megan Greene** (External) — Score: ~+8 (Hawk)
- Voted hold in Feb; "more prolonged period of policy restriction likely warranted"
- Jan 23: "Forks in the Curve" speech — warned that looser Fed policy could push up UK inflation, warranting slower withdrawal of restriction
- Explicit on persistence risk, sees services inflation as structural
- Term ends Jul 2026 — approaching end of tenure

**Clare Lombardelli** (DG Monetary Policy) — Score: ~+6 (Lean Hawk)
- Voted hold in Feb; concerned about wage strength and structural productivity weakness
- Feb minutes: "data continue broadly to show strength in wages and underlying inflation, weak activity and softening employment"
- Worried about structural vs cyclical productivity; uncertain about neutral rate
- Known inflation hawk since Treasury days

**Catherine L. Mann** (External) — Score: ~+2 (Neutral/Lean Hawk)
- **MAJOR SHIFT**: Previously the most hawkish MPC member, surprised markets by voting for 50bp cut in Feb 2025
- Now in hold camp but with "greater confidence" risk would be mitigated by lower near-term inflation path
- Emphasis on risks from weaker activity
- Watchpoint: If she pivots to cut, changes balance to 4-5 (cut wins)

**Huw Pill** (Chief Economist) — Score: ~+10 (Hawk)
- Most hawkish voice currently. Voted hold; "I do not see a need to reduce Bank Rate further at this meeting"
- Feb 13 Santander speech: underlying inflation "going to be two and a half percent" once budget effects strip out
- Feb 24 TSC testimony: "bearing down on inflationary pressures remains necessary," "risks to inflation on the upside"
- Annual Report: "more cautious pace of withdrawing restriction" appropriate
- Opposed Dec 2025 cut

### CUT BLOC (4)

**Sarah Breeden** (DG Financial Stability) — Score: ~-8 (Lean Dove)
- Voted cut in Feb; part of the 4 who wanted 25bp reduction
- Policy-relevant speeches limited (recent focus on payments, stablecoins, DSS)
- Weight on demand weakness and loosening labour market

**Dave Ramsden** (DG Markets & Banking) — Score: ~-8 (Lean Dove)
- Voted cut in Feb
- Jan 14: Resolution speech — institutional focus, no direct rate signal
- Consistent dove in recent meetings; focus on labour market deterioration

**Swati Dhingra** (External) — Score: ~-18 (Dove)
- Most dovish member. Voted cut in Feb.
- Feb minutes: "inflation persistence scenario less compelling given prevailing weakness in activity"
- "Return of inflation to near-target alleviates concerns about threshold effects"
- Consistently advocates faster cutting; has voted cut at every recent hold

**Alan Taylor** (External) — Score: ~-15 (Dove)
- Voted cut in Feb. Publicly forecasted 3 rate cuts in 2026 (to 3.0%)
- Joined Sep 2024 and has been dovish from the start
- Focus on labour market weakness, disinflation momentum

## 4. SCORING FRAMEWORK

### Adaptation from FOMC Model

The FOMC tracker uses a -50 to +50 scale on three dimensions. For the BoE, we adapt:

**Dimension 1: Policy Stance vs. Neutral** (-50 to +50)
- Same concept: where does the member think rates should be relative to neutral?
- Key calibration: Bank Rate at 3.75%, market-implied neutral ~3.25%, so ~50bp above neutral (less restrictive than FOMC's 62.5bp gap)

**Dimension 2: Inflation vs. Growth Focus** (-50 to +50)
- Positive = inflation persistence worry dominant
- Negative = growth/employment worry dominant
- BoE has dual mandate (price stability primary, growth secondary) — very similar to FOMC

**Dimension 3: Rate Direction Signal** (-50 to +50)
- Positive = signaling hold/hike, patience, restrictiveness needed
- Negative = signaling cut, easing, accommodation appropriate

**Composite**: Weighted average → same -50 to +50 scale

### BoE-Specific Scoring Prompt Adjustments:
- Reference rate: Bank Rate 3.75% (not FFR)
- Neutral: ~3.25% (market-implied, MPC doesn't publish explicit)
- Policy gap: ~50bp above neutral
- Key BoE-specific phrases to score:
  - "gradual and careful" = hawkish (Pill's signature)
  - "restrictiveness" / "restrictive" = hawk signal
  - "balance of risks" = neutral
  - "loosening labour market" / "slack" = dovish
  - "persistence" = hawkish
  - "insurance" = dovish
  - "data-dependent" = neutral
- Individual vote rationales in minutes are the RICHEST scoring source (more detailed than any FOMC speech)

## 5. DATA SOURCES FOR SCRAPER

### Primary: Bank of England Speeches
**URL pattern**: `https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/{year}/{month}/{slug}`
**RSS feed**: `https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/rss/speeches`

## 6. SCRAPER ARCHITECTURE

### boe_scraper.py — Key Design

```
Sources to scrape:
1. BoE speeches RSS → bankofengland.co.uk/rss/speeches
2. BoE minutes pages → bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/
3. TSC testimony → committees.parliament.uk/work/68/

Member map (9 members):
MEMBER_MAP = {
    "bailey": ["andrew bailey", "bailey", "governor"],
    "lombardelli": ["clare lombardelli", "lombardelli"],
    "breeden": ["sarah breeden", "breeden"],
    "ramsden": ["dave ramsden", "ramsden", "sir dave"],
    "pill": ["huw pill", "pill", "chief economist"],
    "mann": ["catherine mann", "mann", "catherine l mann", "catherine l. mann"],
    "dhingra": ["swati dhingra", "dhingra"],
    "greene": ["megan greene", "greene"],
    "taylor": ["alan taylor", "taylor"],
}

Scoring prompt calibration:
- Bank Rate: 3.75%
- Neutral estimate: 3.25%
- Policy gap: 50bp above neutral
- Target: 2% CPI
- Last vote: 5-4 hold (Feb 5, 2026)
- Next meeting: Mar 19, 2026
```

### Minutes Parser — UNIQUE TO BOE
The BoE minutes contain paragraph-by-paragraph member vote rationales (paragraphs 16-20 in Feb 2026 minutes). These should be parsed into individual member entries:

```
For each meeting:
1. Fetch minutes PDF/HTML
2. Extract individual vote rationale paragraphs (member name → text)
3. Score each as a separate corpus entry with type="minutes_rationale"
4. Weight these more heavily than general speeches (they're direct policy statements)
```

### Corpus Schema (boe_corpus.json):
```json
{
  "member": "pill",
  "name": "Huw Pill",
  "date": "2026-02-05",
  "source": "MPC Minutes — February 2026",
  "type": "minutes_rationale",
  "url": "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2026/february-2026",
  "text": "I do not see a need to reduce Bank Rate further at this meeting...",
  "vote": "hold",
  "score": {
    "stance": 12,
    "focus": 8,
    "direction": 10,
    "composite": 10
  }
}
```

---

## 7. DASHBOARD DESIGN

### Tab Structure (mirroring FOMC dashboard):

1. **TIME SERIES** — MPC composite score over time (from first cut Aug 2024 → present)
2. **MEMBERS** — 9-member bar chart with scores, votes, roles
3. **VOTE SPLITS** — BoE-specific: visualize the 5-4, 6-3, 7-2 splits over time (replaces FOMC "shifts" tab since BoE publishes votes)
4. **RATE PATH** — Bank Rate staircase with BoE vs Fed vs ECB overlay option
5. **MARCH PREVIEW** — Pre-meeting assessment
6. **SCENARIOS** — Outcome probabilities
7. **MARKET** — SONIA futures / market-implied path

### BoE-Specific Visual: Vote Split Timeline
This replaces the FOMC "dot plot" tab — the BoE doesn't have dots, but the vote split is THE signal. A stacked bar showing Hold vs Cut at each meeting, with individual member names in each bar, tells the story of how the committee is evolving.

---

## 8. MARCH 19 MEETING PREVIEW — INITIAL ASSESSMENT

### Base Case: HOLD at 3.75% (70%) — but closer than Feb

**Why hold likely:**
- Pill, Greene, Lombardelli remain firmly in hold camp
- Bailey showed no urgency to cut in recent speeches
- Feb CPI data (due Mar 12) could still show sticky services
- UK data since Feb meeting: mixed but not weak enough to force cut

**Why cut risk is higher than Feb:**
- 5-4 was already knife-edge; one flip = majority for cut
- Mann is the swing vote — she's expressed "greater confidence" in disinflation
- If Mann flips → 5-4 for CUT (Bailey may follow to maintain consensus)
- Market pricing: ~35-40% probability of March cut (higher than Feb was)
- CPI expected to drop sharply in April (energy bill measures) — MPC may want to "get ahead"
- Taylor publicly called for 3 cuts in 2026 — more aggressive than consensus

**March-specific factors:**
- No MPR at this meeting (non-forecast round) — less analytical cover for a surprise
- Mar 12: Feb CPI release — the single most important data point
- UK labour market data release mid-March
- Global context: US tariff uncertainty, ECB path

### Scenario Probabilities:
| Scenario | Prob | Vote | Signal |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| Hold (status quo) | 60% | 5-4 or 6-3 | Patient, data-dependent |
| Hold (hawkish tilt) | 10% | 7-2 or 8-1 | Mann rejoins hold camp firmly |
| Cut 25bp | 25% | 5-4 | Mann flips, Bailey may follow |
| Cut 25bp (dovish) | 5% | 6-3 or 7-2 | Multiple flips on weak data |

### Key Watchpoints:
1. **Mann's positioning** — Any speech or signal between now and Mar 19 is critical
2. **Feb CPI (Mar 12)** — Core services is the swing variable
3. **Labour market data** — Further loosening strengthens cut case
4. **Bailey's tone** — If he signals openness, the committee follows
