## Base Case: Hold at 3.50–3.75% (High Conviction)

The FOMC will hold the federal funds rate unchanged at the March meeting. CME FedWatch implies a ~96% probability of no action. Our tone tracker composite — derived from 172 scored speeches across all 21 FOMC participants — confirms the committee's center of gravity has shifted decisively hawkish since the December 2025 SEP, which projected just one 25bp cut in 2026 (median end-year dot: 3.375%). The intermeeting period has only reinforced that stance.

## What Changed Since January

**The January minutes (released Feb 18) were the inflection point.** Three features stood out and are consistent with our tone scores:

1. **Rate hike language entered the record.** "Several participants" commented that hikes could be appropriate if inflation remains elevated — language entirely absent from December. Our tracker flags this as a significant hawkish shift in the committee's risk distribution, moving the tail from one-sided (cuts) to genuinely two-sided.

2. **Labor market anxiety collapsed.** A "vast majority" said downside employment risks had "diminished," a sharp upgrade from December when "most" still saw those risks tilted to the downside. The January payrolls print (+130K) provided cover, and our tone scores for centrist members (Williams, Jefferson, Cook) shifted toward neutral-to-hawkish on the labor axis.

3. **Inflation hawks set the bar higher.** "Some" participants said no easing should occur "until there was clear indication that disinflation was firmly back on track." This is a higher hurdle than anything in the December minutes and aligns with our tracker showing Bowman, Logan, Hammack, and Kashkari clustered in hawkish territory on the inflation-focus dimension.

**Two dissenters from January (Waller and Miran) are retreating.** Waller — the most notable dove on the board — described a March cut as a "coin flip" at the NABE conference on Feb 23, conditioned entirely on the February jobs report (due March 6). This is a material walk-back from his January dissent statement, where he argued policy was "still restricting economic activity" and cited near-zero 2025 job growth. Our tracker registered this as a dovish-to-neutral shift for Waller.

**Goolsbee (2026 voter) turned hawkish.** Speaking Feb 24, the Chicago Fed president stated flatly that 3% inflation "is not good enough" and that the committee has "been burned by assuming transitory inflation." Our scoring places Goolsbee — historically a reliable dove — in the cautious-neutral camp, a significant migration from his late-2025 positioning.

## The New SEP: What to Watch

March is a "big" meeting — the committee will release updated Summary of Economic Projections and the dot plot. Key expectations:

**Dots:** The median 2026 dot is likely to remain at 3.375% (one cut), but the risk is skewed toward an upward revision to 3.625% (zero cuts). Several members who dotted for one cut in December may now see the bar as too high given sticky inflation above 2% and a stabilizing labor market. The range of dots (2.125% to 3.875% in December) will likely compress from the dovish tail as Waller and Miran moderate their views.

**Inflation forecasts:** The December SEP had 2026 PCE at 2.4% (vs. 2.0% target). Expect a slight upward revision, possibly to 2.5%, reflecting persistent services inflation and lingering tariff pass-through. Core PCE is the key variable — it remains the primary friction point preventing rate action.

**Growth:** Likely revised modestly higher. Q4 2025 GDP came in at 1.4% annualized (down from 4.4% in Q3), but the government shutdown distorted the figures by roughly a percentage point. Underlying private demand grew 2.4%. The staff revised growth up through 2028 at the January meeting.

**Unemployment:** Likely steady at 4.4–4.5%. The committee's "vast majority" now views the labor market as stabilized, not deteriorating.

## Press Conference Tone: Expect Patient Hawkishness

Powell's presser will likely echo his January framing — that it is "hard to look at the data and say that policy is significantly restrictive right now." We expect the Chair to:

- **Emphasize patience and data-dependence.** The January statement language about "extent and timing of additional adjustments" will remain, signaling no urgency in either direction.

- **Acknowledge the two-sided risk profile.** The minutes introduced hike language; Powell will not dismiss it but will frame it as a tail scenario, not a base case. He will stress the committee is "well-positioned" to respond in either direction.

- **Downplay tariff effects on monetary policy.** Both Powell (at Jackson Hole 2025) and Waller have framed tariff-driven price increases as "one-time shifts in the price level" to be looked through, so long as expectations remain anchored. The SCOTUS ruling striking down broad executive tariff powers (Feb 20) and the subsequent Section 122 reimposition at 15% for 150 days adds uncertainty, but the Fed will treat this as noise unless expectations move.

- **Avoid forward guidance.** With Powell's term ending in May and Kevin Warsh nominated as successor, the Chair has every incentive to leave the incoming leadership maximum optionality. Expect deliberately vague language about the rate path.

- **Address political pressure obliquely.** Given the extraordinary backdrop — DOJ subpoenas against Powell (Jan 11), White House demands for rates "as low as 1%" — the Chair will reaffirm institutional independence without engaging directly. The Jan 11 statement was the firewall; the presser will be about economics, not politics.

## Committee Composition & Tone Map

**2026 Voting Rotation:** The rotation brought in Hammack (Cleveland), Kashkari (Minneapolis), Logan (Dallas), and Paulson (Chicago, replacing Goolsbee mid-year), alongside permanent voters Powell, Williams, Barr, Bowman, Cook, Jefferson, Miran, and Waller.

| Bloc | Members (Voters in **bold**) | Tone Score | Lean |
|------|------------------------------|------------|------|
| Hawks | **Bowman**, **Logan**, **Hammack**, **Kashkari** | Hawkish | Hold / hike-open |
| Centrists | **Powell**, **Williams**, **Jefferson**, **Cook**, **Barr**, **Paulson** | Neutral-to-hawkish | Hold / cut later |
| Doves | **Waller**, **Miran**, (Goolsbee non-voter) | Dovish → moderating | Cut preferred but data-dependent |

The hawk bloc holds ~4 of 12 votes outright, with centrists comfortable on hold. Even the doves are hedging. Consensus for a hold is overwhelming. The more interesting question is whether the statement language moves toward explicitly two-sided guidance — our tracker suggests it will.

## Key Data Before the Meeting

| Release | Date | Significance |
|---------|------|-------------|
| February Employment | March 6 | Waller's "coin flip" resolves here. A second strong print (~100K+) locks in the hold and may flip Waller to hold. A weak print keeps the cut caucus alive for May. |
| February CPI | March 11 | Services inflation is the swing variable. Core CPI above 0.3% m/m reinforces the hawks. |
| February Retail Sales | March 14 | Consumer resilience gauge. Strong spending supports hold. |

## Bottom Line

**Hold, hawkish statement, cautious presser.** The March meeting is about consolidating the pause, not signaling the next move. The tone tracker shows a committee that has migrated hawkish since December — not because members want to hike, but because they see no urgency to cut while inflation lingers above target and the labor market stabilizes. The new SEP dots are the main event: any upward shift in the median would formalize what the speeches are already telling us — 2026 easing is a second-half story at best, and zero cuts is a live scenario.

The biggest risk to this call is a materially weak February jobs report, which could re-open the door for a May cut. But barring that, the Fed is content to wait — and the tone data says they've been telling us so for weeks.
